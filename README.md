##Intro
Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: Node.js, Firebase, socket.io

I tried to design a robust backend that used No-SQL technologies, had significant error control, and even provided real-time updates if two people were using the web-app at the same time. My hope is to demonstrate my skill with infrastructure and backend development with this project.

## Features
- Basic CRUD functionalities
- Generate monthly PDF reports to track inventory gain, loss, and other metrics
- Real-time updates if someone else changes anything
- Simple sort functions in the data table

##Development
Install Node.js and NPM from their respective web tutorials
Clone the repository
