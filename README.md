Hey! My name is Krish and I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Thanks for taking the time to look at my Shopify Intern Challenge for the backend and infrastructure positions! If you want to check everything out fast, here are the quick links:

Deployed project url: https://shopify-intern-challenge-s22.herokuapp.com/

## Intro

Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: Node.js, Firebase, socket.io

I tried to design a robust backend that used No-SQL technologies, had significant error control, and even provided real-time updates if two people were using the web-app at the same time. My hope is to demonstrate my skill with infrastructure and backend development with this project.

## Features

- Basic CRUD functionalities
- Generate monthly PDF reports to track inventory gain, loss, and other metrics
- Real-time updates if someone else changes anything
- Simple sort functions in the data table

## Development

Install Node.js and NPM from their respective web tutorials: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/ <br />

Clone this repository <br />

Open a terminal in the new cloned folder <br />

First check node and npm by running `npm -v` and `node -v` in your terminal<br />

cd into the server directory and `npm install`<br />

run `node app.js`<br />

In a new terminal cd into the client directory and `npm install`<br />

run `npm start`<br />

After a couple of seconds you should be able to see the front end on http://localhost:3000 and it will automatically access the backend<br />
